## Program Name _How-To you do_ 10th Independent Project

## Description

This exercise is designed to be a hub for DIY and "How-to" projects uploaded by users and searchable for other patrons to view. Using Angular CLI, this is practice in setting up ng, routing to nested components, sending data down with inputs, passing actions up with EventEmitters, and filtering data with pipes. The page will have a section for uploading projects, where a series of forms will be filled out until the overall form is submitted in to a database. Users will be able to search for relevant projects on how to do or make a project and the respective "how-to's" will display their title. Then a user can click the title to get to the details of the step-by-step instructable.

### Specs

| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-----------------    | :------------------ | :-------------- |
| User can add a project to a database by creating an instance of their project | _Input:_ Title, category, difficulty, number of steps, [array with each step] is enter in each specified form. | _Output:_ A saved formatted and styled project that is easy for anyone to read. |
| Returns each project for a searched category | _Input:_ "Automotive" | _Output:_ A list of project titles that have been uploaded by previous users that fall under the "automotive" category. |
| When user enters '5' for number of steps, user will be able to write step 1 through 5 in order and seperately | _Input:_ "5" | _Output:_ First form displays, user types, clicks next, second form displays, ... 5th form displays, user writes final step, clicks submit, and project is saved. |
| A project can be editted by a project owner | _Input:_ User clicks edit button and updates the number of steps and adds a few more | _Output:_ New, updated project will be saved. |
